    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the last lab that you had a training accuracy close to 90% and a test set accuracy close to 76%.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with your previous machine learning work, you should be asking a couple of questions:\n",
    "- Is there high bias? yes/no\n",
    "- Is there high variance? yes/no \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll use the a train-validate-test partition as well as a validation set to get better insights of how to tune neural networks using regularization techniques. You'll start by repeating the process from the last section: importing the data and performing preprocessing including one-hot encoding. From there, you'll define and compile the model like before. However, this time, when you are presented with the `history` dictionary of the model, you will have additional data entries for not only the train and test set but also the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct and run a basic model in Keras\n",
    "* Construct a validation set and explain potential benefits\n",
    "* Apply L1 and L2 regularization\n",
    "* Apply dropout regularization\n",
    "* Observe and comment on the effect of using more data"

    "Notice an interesting pattern here: although the training accuracy keeps increasing when going through more epochs, and the training loss keeps decreasing, the validation accuracy and loss seem to be reaching a limit around the 60th epoch. This means that you're probably **overfitting** the model to the training data when you train for many epochs past this dropoff point of around 40 epochs. Luckily, you learned how to tackle overfitting in the previous lecture! Since it seems clear that you are training too long, include early stopping at the 60th epoch first."
